## Overview

[trimsec](https://crates.io/crates/trimsec) provides an easy way to accurately
estimate how much time you save on watching videos when using speed multipliers.
This is essentially helpful when watching recorded classes or documentaries
online, in case you do not have enough time to spare based on your situation.

Since I am also a student and both coordinating between my routine, as well as
manually doing the math required to estimate my overall hours for study wasn't
an option I'd consider - I chose to program a tool that would automate the
process for me.

If you like this tool, **consider starring the repository âœ¨** on GitHub! It
really encourages me to build more open-source tools like this. :D

## Usage

As shown in the demo above, you can use `trimsec` by running the following command:

```bash
$ trimsec <duration> <speed>
```

Here, `<speed>` is the speed multiplier you are using, and `<duration>` is the
duration of the video you are watching. For example, if you are watching a 1-hour
video at 2x speed, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ trimsec 1h 2x
```

This will output the time you saved by watching the video at 2x speed. You can
also combine multiple duration indicators and float-point speed multipliers. For
example:

```bash
$ trimsec 1h30m 1.5x
```

In order to calculate multiple durations at once with the same speed multiplier,
you can use the following pattern:

```bash
# Use a '+' to separate the durations.
$ trimsec 1h30m+2h50m 1.25x
```

Here we can clearly see that all of the commands above follow a similar pattern:

- While specifying the duration, you must use any combination of the following formats:
  - `<days>d` for days
  - `<hours>h` for hours
  - `<minutes>m` for minutes
  - `<seconds>s` for seconds
- The speed multiplier must be a float-point number, and *can* suffixed with `x`, such as:
  - `1.5x` indicates 1.5 times the original speed.
  - But, `1.5` is also valid and indicates the same speed multiplier.

## Installation

### cargo

If you have [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) and [Cargo](https://crates.io/)
installed, you can install `trimsec` by running the following command:

```bash
$ cargo install trimsec
```

### mise

To install `trimsec` as a tool using [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise), use
the following command:

```bash
$ mise use -g cargo:trimsec
```

### Manual installation

If you do not have Rust and Cargo installed, you can clone this repository and
build the binary manually:

```bash
# clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/hitblast/trimsec.git
$ cd trimsec

# output: target/release/trimsec
$ cargo build --release
```

After building the binary, move the binary to a directory which is registered in
the `$PATH` environment variable. Here's an example with the `~/.local/bin/`
directory on macOS:

```bash
$ mv target/release/trimsec ~/.local/bin/

# (optional) this code appends the binary path to the PATH environment variable
$ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

# now you can run the binary from anywhere
$ trimsec 1h20m 1.75x
```
